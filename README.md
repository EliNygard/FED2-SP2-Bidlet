## About the Project

This is a website for the fictional auction house Bidlet. A website where you can register as a user to buy and sell items, or just visit the site to browse through all the items on auction. 

The goal of this Semester Project is to take the skills I have learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

I have designed and created this website to meet the fictional company's wishes and requiremnets: 
They want to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction. When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

API documentation used on the project: 
The API can be found under Auction House endpoints in the [Noroff API documentation](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2)

I aimed to design and build a website where it is easy for the user to move around the site and find items they are interested in. I think the search function is an important part of an auction website and especially wanted that to be working well for the user.
